window.SIDEBAR_ITEMS = {"fn":[["CarryOn","The “CarryOn()” function is used for determining if the user wants to add more words to the glossary. The user can input 1 to continue, or any other number to quit. This function returns the number the player entered to the main function."],["CheckGuess","The “CheckGuess()” function is used to see if the player’s guess matches a character of the word being used. If it is, the function will check how many times that letter shows up in the word, and will retun that value."],["CheckVector","This function checks a vector passed through it to see if a character that is also passed through it, is within the vector. If it is, return a true bool value, and if not, return a false bool value."],["GameOn","This is the main function that handles the game. It prompts the user/player over and over again, asking for guesses of what letters might be in the correct word. The function will keep prompting these questions and evaluating what the player inputs, until the player either wins the game or loses it. This script will display what letters the player has already used, which are wrong, and which are right. The script will also tell the player if they have already guessed a letter or not. In this function you will see comments of some old code I used before I moved onto better tactics."],["Guess","The “Guess() function is used to prompt the user/player for a guess of a letter of the unknown word.” When the player/user enters in a guess, the function will only take the first letter/character of their guess, To ensure that they did not enter in too many letters. This function returns their guess to the function that called it."],["HangMan","This function displays the status of the hangman, depending on how many guesses/lives/mistakes left the player has. With each mistake the player mistakes, a new body part of the hangman will be displayed, entire the entire body is shown, and the player loses the game. This function is void."],["OrderLetters","The “OrderLetters(&mut Chars, &mut Vec” function is a somewhat complicated function. The Vector passed through gets compared with the Chars of the word being guessed in hang man. If an element of the vector matches up with a character from the word being guessed, that element has whatever letter it is printed. Otherwise, a blank ’ _ ’ is printed where a correct letter would be. This function prints the correctly guessed letters in order of how they are in the correct word,  to make it easier for the user/player to guess what the word is. This function is void."],["main","Main function of the program. Program starts with the basic question of “what is your name?” The function then goes right into the point of this script. The main function asks the player to input some words that they would like to be featured in the game, and the script will randomly pick one of those words and tell the player how many letters/characters it has. The script will then call the GameOn() function to begin the game. Once the game ends, no matter the outcome, the script will thank the player for playing."]]};
